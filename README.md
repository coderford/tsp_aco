TSP with ACO (Ant System algorithm)
===================================

A C++ implementation of the Ant System algorithm for solving symmetrical Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).

Datasets are from [TSPLIB](https://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/comopt/software/TSPLIB95/)

Currently, only problems which have distance type EUC\_2D or EUC\_3D can be handled by this program.

To compile, run: `make`

To execute: `./aco datasets/eil51.tsp`
